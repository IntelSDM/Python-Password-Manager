# PythonProject
This is a basic Password manager system using SQL and Python. The purpose is to be able to store passwords for things such as an RDP under a username and password which will work on a server for storage.

It implements a TLS protocol for secure data transmission. The SQL database is unprotected since this was just a project i had to do and has no real world usage. Its simple and it works.
I was given 6 months of notice before i had to hand this in but decided to ignore it while working on more important projects and then the deadline hit and in the last week of the assignment i finished it so its very rushed but it works.
